# Projects
### [NHL Draft Visualization](hockey-draft-viz) 
Inspired by this article on the [NFL draft](https://www.news.gatech.edu/2017/04/19/interactive-visualization-illustrates-uncertainty-nfl-draft) 
this project shows the last 15 years of draft picks for NHL teams.  Data was obtained from
[nhl.com](nhl.com) using their _REST_ API and processed with this [code](https://github.com/JonathanFung13/nhl_fantasy).
The visualization was done with D3.js [view code](https://github.com/JonathanFung13/hockey-draft-viz).

### [Alberta Election History](missing)
The Canadian province of Alberta had it's 30th election in April.  This animated gif using open data shared by the
government animates this history.  Visualization done in Python with Matplotlib and Seaborn packages.

# About me
Currently pursuing a non-thesis Masters in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology via their 
distance-learning program.  I have completed 9 out of 10 courses in the Machine Learning specialization with one 
elective remaining in fall 2019.

This program has been one of the best experiences of my life, the coursework is project heavy, and the student body is 
diverse & engaged.  More information on the program can be seen in this video. [PBS NewsHour video](https://youtu.be/6xNpquytdzw)

Prior to this program, I worked in the video game industry as a project manager and localization producer in the 
Bay Area and Vancouver, BC.  These roles were fast-paced and required the highest quality of work to uphold major 
brands such as _Star Wars_ and _X-Men_.

My undergraduate degree is a B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Alberta.  I was accepted into their
Co-op program and gained valuable work experience in the pulp & paper industry as well as with a power utility.
