# Projects
### [NHL Draft Visualization](hockey-draft-viz) 
Inspired by this article on the [NFL draft](https://www.news.gatech.edu/2017/04/19/interactive-visualization-illustrates-uncertainty-nfl-draft) 
this project shows the NHL draft over the last 15 years.  Data was obtained from
[nhl.com](https://www.nhl.com/) using their _REST_ API and processed with this [code](https://github.com/JonathanFung13/nhl_fantasy).
The visualization was developed with D3.js [view code](https://github.com/JonathanFung13/hockey-draft-viz).

### [Alberta Election History](election-ab)
The Canadian province of Alberta held it's 30th election in April.  This animated gif using open data shared by the
government animates this history.  Visualization was done in Python with the Matplotlib and Seaborn packages.  

### [Patient Health Predictions](https://cs6440-f18-prj14.apps.hdap.gatech.edu/)
Machine learning group project to predict chances of a patient developing 
a chronic condition based on survey answers, done in conjunction with the OHDSI collaborative.

Served as a front-end developer on the project, responsible for setting up Django, the prediction histogram,

the Bootstrap framework were used to develop this project.

# About me
Currently pursuing a non-thesis _Masters in Computer Science_ at the _Georgia Institute of Technology_ via their 
distance-learning program.  I have completed 9 out of 10 courses in the Machine Learning specialization with one 
elective remaining in the fall of 2019.

The _Georgia Tech_ program has been one of the best experiences of my life, the coursework is project heavy, the 
student body is diverse & engaged, and the quality of instruction is world-class.  More information on the program 
can be seen in this video. [PBS NewsHour video](https://youtu.be/6xNpquytdzw)

Prior to this program, I worked in the video game industry as a project manager and localization producer both in the 
Bay Area and Vancouver.  These roles were fast-paced and required the highest quality of work to uphold major 
brands such as _Star Wars_ and _X-Men_.

My undergraduate degree is a _B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering_ from the _University of Alberta_.  I was accepted into 
their Co-op program and gained valuable work experience in the pulp & paper industry as well as with a power utility.  

Currently I reside in Vancouver, BC.
